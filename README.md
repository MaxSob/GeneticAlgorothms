# Simple Genetic Algorithms
Basic implementation of a simple genetic algorithm in C++

## Classes

* Coin: This class simulates a probability charged coin the coin is set to true if the probability exceeds the related parameter which is used to initialize the coin.
* Individuals: This class simulates an individual in the spread, is represented as a vector of zeros and one
* SimpleGeneticAlgorithm: This class implements a genetic algorithm parametrized by the number of generations, the chromosome size.

## Algorithm
The algorithm is implemented following the next steps:
* Evaluation
* Selection
* Cross
* Mutation
